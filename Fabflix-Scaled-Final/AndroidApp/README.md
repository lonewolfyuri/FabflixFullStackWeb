## Running this project

This Android app depends on [cs122b-spring20-project2-login-cart-example](https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-spring20-project2-login-cart-example) as the backend server to work.

Follow the instructions on [Canvas](https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/26486/pages/p4-task-2-developing-an-android-app-for-fabflix) to set up the Android App Project

Note: Don't forget to change the URL in Login class to match your deployed backend
